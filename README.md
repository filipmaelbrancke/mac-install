# mac-install

My OS X on MacBook Pro install.

## Getting Started

- Currently tested against [Catalina 10.15.7](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/)
- Install [Xcode 10](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

Open up the OS X Terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/filipmaelbrancke/mac-install.git
cd mac-install
```

### Setup Machine

If you're setting up a machine run the following:

```sh
./setup-machine.sh
```

### Maintain Machine

Keeping the machine up to date:

```sh
./update-machine.sh
```

This will :  

- update macOS software
- update & upgrade homebrew packages
- update & propose to upgrade homebrew cask packages
- update npm / apm
- suggest updates to apps installed through appstore

### Info

Originally based on Pivotal's setup scripts (https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup)  

Some `defaults` are commented out for the moment, due to Mojave's permissions. Adding Terminal/iTerm and bash to Full Disk Access allows to set `defaults` again, but it might be better to look up how to address the container directly...
