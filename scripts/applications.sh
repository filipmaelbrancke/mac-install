# VeraCrypt config: by default VeraCrypt will not alter the timestamp of the volume after it has been created
# This will prevent Cloud syncing from recognizing changes to the volume, and prevent synchronization
# So: 'uncheck' "Preserve modification timestamp of file containers"
# ### cp files/veracrypt-configuration.xml ~/"Library/Application Support/VeraCrypt/Configuration.xml"
# ditto (OSX-specific app) will create the directory structure that is missing in the destination
ditto files/veracrypt-configuration.xml ~/"Library/Application Support/VeraCrypt/Configuration.xml"


# Add the brew-cask-upgrade tool: allows to upgrade applications installed with homebrew cask

# apps can be updated with 'brew cu app'
